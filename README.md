# Repository Guide

`maize_data` folder contains the following: 
* 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on increasing position values and with missing data encoded by this symbol: ?
* 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on decreasing position values and with missing data encoded by this symbol: -
* 1 file with all SNPs with unknown positions in the genome (these need not be ordered in any particular way)
* 1 file with all SNPs with multiple positions in the genome (these need not be ordered in any particular way)

`teosinte_data` folder contains the following: 
* 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on increasing position values and with missing data encoded by this symbol: ?
* 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on decreasing position values and with missing data encoded by this symbol: -
* 1 file with all SNPs with unknown positions in the genome (these need not be ordered in any particular way)
* 1 file with all SNPs with multiple positions in the genome (these need not be ordered in any particular way)

`raw_data` folder contains the original `snp_position.txt` and `fang_et_al_genotypes.txt` files

`working_files` folder contains the files created and used in the analysis

`assignment.md` contains the detailed workflow of how the files in `maize_data` and `teosinte_data` were created.
